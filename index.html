						<h2>I like to code!</h2>
						<p>Life has spurred me to change paths and pursue a career path that enables my inner self to learn, explore, and create.  In 2018, I chose to take an immersive dive into software development by attending Prime Digital Academy.  Prime has changed my life and I am proud to say, I love coding!  Below is a showcase of projects which I am proud to have worked on...and continue to work on.  Take a peek at the samples and if you want to chat about my work - reach out and say, 'hey!'.</p>

								<h3>Local Crate</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The big thing!  This is the capstone project for my whole experience as a student at Prime Digital Academy.  Local Crate asked us to create a space where their vendors, farmers, makers and suppliers could share information or the "what's up" in their world to the Local Crate customers.  A group of four of us tackled this project and we couldn't be happier with what we created for them in 3 weeks.</p>

								<h3>therMobile</h3>
							</header>
							<p>TherMobile is a mobile-friendly full-stack web application to track Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  TherMobile allows a user to connect an IoT temperature logging device to their dashboard for logging of device data to a database and control real world things based on this data.  This JavaScript app is built in React.js and originated as my solo project at Prime Digital Academy. It persists as a limitless platform for continued learning, tinkering and building.</p>

								<h3>Other Hobbies</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I'm a gearhead at heart - I throughly enjoy getting dirty building engines, maintaining and driving my track car, talking cars (airplanes, too!), and being around things that make air and gasoline go boom!
								<br/>
								<br/>
							My other passions include IoT, hockey, video games, being outside, but, nothing means more to me than being with my family!</p>
